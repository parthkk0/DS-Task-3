# DS-Task-3
Welcome to the Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis Project! 🎉 This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the Bank Marketing dataset. The project utilizes Python's powerful data analysis libraries, including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, to explore the data, visualize patterns, and build a predictive model for marketing campaign success.

### Sample Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
### Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of my work with Prodigy Infotech, where I aimed to gain deeper insights into the factors affecting the success of marketing campaigns. Here’s an overview of the steps involved:

Loading the Data 📂: We begin by loading the Bank Marketing dataset from a CSV file using Pandas. This allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.

## Data Visualization 🌈: Utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib, we create various visualizations to explore the relationships between different features:

Building a Decision Tree Model 🌳: We build a decision tree classifier to predict the success of marketing campaigns based on customer data. The model is visualized using Matplotlib to interpret the decision rules.

**Model Training**: We split the data into training and testing sets, then train a decision tree classifier.
Model Visualization: We visualize the decision tree to understand the decision-making process of the model. Various parameters like max_depth and ccp_alpha are tuned to improve interpretability and performance.
- **Conclusion and Insights 🧠**:
The visualizations and analysis provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the success of marketing campaigns. This project demonstrates the power of exploratory data analysis and machine learning in uncovering patterns and informing strategic decisions.
